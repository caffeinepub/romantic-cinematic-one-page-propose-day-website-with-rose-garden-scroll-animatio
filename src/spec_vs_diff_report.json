  "summary": "REQ-14 appears implemented: Love Letter heading text changed to \"Meri Makhan Mishri\" and a Heart icon is rendered immediately next to the heading with an animation class that is disabled when `prefersReducedMotion` is true. REQ-15 appears partially implemented: the Love Letter body starts with the new provided narrative and the old text is not shown in the visible portion, but the diff is truncated so the full word-for-word replacement cannot be verified.",

      "reason": "`frontend/src/components/ProposeDayPage.tsx` is truncated mid-paragraph, so it’s not possible to confirm from the diff summary that the full narrative text (including the later paragraphs) matches exactly and that all previous Love Letter paragraphs are fully removed.",
